# Hello! 👋 

Here's a bit about me...

## Early years 🍼

I'm Pablo, and, from as long as I can remember, I’ve enjoyed building stuff with computers 👨🏻‍💻.

From playing with BASIC, to doing ASCII art in WordStar, to making pixel art with MS Paint, to coding a website for my mom’s company in Flash… my desire to create things with code led me to studying Computer Science and start a career as a Software Engineer.

As a software newbie, I joined a consulting firm, where I worked on a boring (and pretty ugly) J2EE internal app for a huge company. This was the kind of job where you had to dress-up to write code. I soon understood that “big corp” wasn’t for me.

## Discovering Ruby on Rails and my passion ✨

I wanted to work on cool stuff with cool technologies and cool people! So, I went back to uni to study for a Master’s degree in Web Engineering. That’s where I discovered Ruby on Rails and instantly felt in love with it.

Inspired by early internet product companies like 37 Signals, Idealista, 11870, Minube, I found my passion: building digital Products with a great UX/UI that solved real customer problems.

## Professional experience 👷‍♂️

For the last decade, I've had the privilege of working at small bootstrapped product companies like BeBanjo, big companies like Google (through the acquisition of Wildfire) and mid-size companies like CARTO. All of these companies had different sizes, ways of working, etc., but they all had one thing in common: a product and a team I felt passionate about. Coincidentally, all of them were B2B SaaS products.

As a Software Engineer, I’ve worked both as a full-stack Ruby on Rails engineer, and as a Frontend Developer. Except from a couple of years where I worked out of the Google campus at Mountain View (who would have told me!), I've worked remotely for most of my career (yes, back when most people were in the office).

In recent years, my curiosity and eagerness to learn more about all things Product led me to explore the field of Product Management, first as the PM for a little JS mapping library, then managing bigger initiatives, and lately as the first PM for a new startup and eCommerce search product called Motive.

## Personality and traits 💃

People often describe me as very responsible, able to see things through, well organized, good communicator, analytical, detail-oriented, pragmatic when it comes to solving problems, and easy to work with.

## Hobbies 🏄‍♂️🛹

Outside of work, while not spending time with my family, I enjoy spending as much time as I can outdoors, practicing all sort of sports (swimming, running, biking, skateboarding and surfing), and reading about self-development, entrepreneurship and all things product.

Thank you!
